*In a context marked by many structural changes and high inequalities, longitudinal studies appear to be particularly useful and revealing in analysing the extent of socio-economic dynamics. This paper aims to propose a broad picture of socio-economic dynamics, in particular labour and migration, in rural areas of Tamil Nadu for the last decade using an original first-hand longitudinal survey called NEEMSIS (Networks, Employment, dEbt, Mobilities, and Skills in India Survey). Although NEEMSIS cannot compete with large-scale national surveys, it reveals what they miss by exploring finer socio-economic processes, such as household financial practices, transformation of work, individual’s access and use of social networks and cognition, and social mobility trajectories.*
